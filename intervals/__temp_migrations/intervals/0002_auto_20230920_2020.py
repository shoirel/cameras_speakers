Of course, in some cases it can be bad luck, but given that this happens systematically, it is interpreted as what scholars call “overprecision”: many people tend to <b>overestimate the precision of their judgment</b>. This tendency has important consequences for the quality of decision-making in many domains. For example, it might make you underdiversify your investment portfolio ("put all your eggs in the same basket"). <b>If you are managing a project, you may underestimate the likelihood that it ends up taking much more time and money than expected</b>. See e.g., <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth-Tenney/publication/316228342_Overprecision_in_Judgment/links/60abfb7b299bf1031fc843a8/Overprecision-in-Judgment.pdf" target="_blank">Overprecision in Judgment (Moore et al.)</a> to learn more (in particular, see section <em>Ecological Evidence of Overprecision</em> for some examples of real-life consequences of overprecision).
